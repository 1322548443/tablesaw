# Machine Learning

## What is ML?
Machine learning is one of a group of synonomous or near synonomous names (like, data mining, or predictive modeling)
applied to an approach to building mathematical models from data. 

There are two kinds, broadly speaking. One kind is called "supervised" learning models, and the other "unsupervised". 

Always we have a set of data, organized in rows and columns, where each row represents a single "case" in the domain of interest.
Each column contains a value representing an attribute of the case we might wish to include in our model. One of these may 
be a thing we want to predict about each case, sometimes called the response variable. The others are potential
"predictor" variables. 

Supervised methods use a training set of data where the predicted value for each case is known.
