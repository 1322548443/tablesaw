Join us in making Java a great platform for data science

Tablesaw makes it easy to use Java for data science, but we can use your help. Here are some ways you can contribute today:

Ask or answer questions
Report or fix a bug
Implement new features and enhancements

Using Github to implement features and fix bugs

If you want to help out with one of our bugs or implement a new feature, here are some suggestions for success.  The basic process looks like this:

Clone Tablesaw
Create your issue branch
Include the issue number in your branch name
Implement your feature or fix the bug
Try to keep your changes small
Send us a pull request.
Our maintainers will review your pull request as soon as we can. You can find our project at Github:

https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw

What makes a good Pull Request?

To summarize:

Address only one issue with a single pull request.
For new functionality, have a conversation with one or more maintainers before putting in too much work. Opening an issue is a good way to start the conversation
Requests with tests are the best
Finally, We love small pull requests. That we we can find time to review them between work, and family, and watching Game of Thrones.
What to Contribute?

Besides the open bugs and feature requests, there are a few features that would be both hugely valuable and relatively easy to implement. Here are some ideas:

Add support for more machine learning algorithms by adding new interfaces to Smile.  Basically, you’re creating methods that transform tables to the format the Smile needs, and wraps the Smile API so that the necessary options can be set through Tablesaw.
Add additional plot types by expanding the interface to the plotting libraries we use. Smile, again, has a number of plot types specialized for ML diagnostics that would be wonderful. We could also use a pie chart, a time series plot, etc.
Implement an interface for a Javascript plotting library (big job, we know), but the best Javascript libraries are awesome.
Email larry@tablesaw.tech if you have any questions about these suggestions.

Become a Maintainer/Committer

We are actively seeking new maintainers for the project. The best way to get involved is to familiarize yourself with the project through use, and make a few minor changes/fixes. After that, introduce yourself by emailing info@tablesaw.tech and we’ll get in touch.
